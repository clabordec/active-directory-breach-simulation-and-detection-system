📌 **Overview**  

The Active Directory Breach Simulation and Detection System is a comprehensive cybersecurity framework designed to help organizations strengthen their Active Directory (AD) environments against real-world threats. By simulating attacks and testing detection mechanisms, the system allows companies to proactively identify vulnerabilities, improve security controls, and enhance incident response strategies.

---

🎯 **Objectives**  
- Install and configure Active Directory to manage resources such as user, computers and groups within the company
- Create a splunk instance to ingest events from the Windows Server that has Active Directory and the target windows machine
- Utilize Kali Linux to perform a brute force attack to see what kind of telemetry that generates, along with using Atomic Red Team as well
